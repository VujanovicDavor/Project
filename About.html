  <h2><br>The first shoes</h2>
    <p>
      The earliest known shoes are sagebrush bark sandals, from aproximately 7000 or 8000 BC.<br><br>

      The world's oldest leather shoe is made of a single pice of cowhide laced with a leather cord along seams at the front and back.<br><br>

      Moccasin are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes typically made out if leather of bison hide. Many of them were decorated with various pearls and other adornments.<br><br>

      Sandals (the precursors of the modern flip-flop). In the ancient egypt they were made of papyrus and palms leaves,<br>
      in Africa they were made of rawhide, in India from wood, in China and Japan rice and straw.<br><br>
    </p>

  <h2>Middle ages and early modern period</h2>
    <p>
      Espadrille is a sandal with a braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often inculedes fabric laces that tie around the ankle.<br><br>

      Pattens was seen as the predecessor of the high-heeled shoe.<br><br>

      Cracow were a style shoe with extremely long toes made out of leather.<br><br>

    </p>
    
  <h2>Industrial era</h2>
  <p>
    In the industrial era the shoemaking were more commercialized in the mid-18th century as ist expanded,<br>
    larege warehouses beagn to stock footwear, made by many small manufacturers from the area.<br><br>

    Until the 19th century shoemaking was traditional handcraft, but by the century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized.<br><br>

    Since the 20th century, advances in rubber, plastic, synthetic cloth and industrial adhesvies<br>
    have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting.<br>
    Leather, which had been the primary material in earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress shoes,<br>
    but athletic shoes often have little or no real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched on,<br>
    are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on.<br><br>
