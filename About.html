    <h2><br>The first shoes</h2>
    <p>
      The earliest known shoes are sagebrush bark sandals, from aproximately 7000 or 8000 BC.<br><br>

      The world's oldest leather shoe is made of a single pice of cowhide laced with a leather cord along seams at the
      front and back.<br><br>

      Moccasin are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes typically made out if leather of bison hide. Many of them were
      decorated with various pearls and other adornments.<br><br>

      Sandals (the precursors of the modern flip-flop). In the ancient egypt they were made of papyrus and palms
      leaves,<br>
      in Africa they were made of rawhide, in India from wood, in China and Japan rice and straw.<br><br>
    </p>


    <h2>Middle ages and early modern period</h2>
    <p>
      Espadrille is a sandal with a braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often inculedes fabric laces that
      tie around the ankle.<br><br>

      Pattens was seen as the predecessor of the high-heeled shoe.<br><br>

      Cracow were a style shoe with extremely long toes made out of leather.<br><br>

      Chopines are a type of women's platform shoe. They were originally used as a patten,<br>
      clog or overshoe to protect the shoes and dress from mud and street soil.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Industrial era</h2>
    <p>
      In the industrial era the shoemaking were more commercialized in the mid-18th century as ist expanded,<br>
      larege warehouses beagn to stock footwear, made by many small manufacturers from the area.<br><br>

      Until the 19th century shoemaking was traditional handcraft, but by the century's end, the process had been almost
      completely mechanized.<br><br>

      Since the 20th century, advances in rubber, plastic, synthetic cloth and industrial adhesvies<br>
      have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting.<br>
      Leather, which had been the primary material in earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress
      shoes,<br>
      but athletic shoes often have little or no real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched on,<br>
      are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on.<br><br>

    </p>

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>
      There are a wide variety of different types of shoes. Most types of shoes are designed for specific activities.
      For example, boots are typically designed for work or heavy outdoor use. <br>
      Athletic shoes are designed for particular sports such as running, walking, or other sports. Some shoes are
      designed to be worn at more formal occasions, and others are designed for casual wear. <br>
      There are also a wide variety of shoes designed for different types of dancing. Orthopedic shoes are special types
      of footwear designed for individuals with particular foot problems or special needs. <br>
      Depending on the activity for which they are designed, some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories.
      <br> For example, Cowboy boots are considered boots, but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as
      dress shoes. <br>
      Hiking boots incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide the extra flexibility and
      comfort of many athletic shoes <br>
      Flip-flops are considered casual footwear <br>
    </p>

    <h2>General</h2>

    <p>
      A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. Shoes are also used as an item of
      decoration and fashion <br>
      The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally
      being tied to function. <br>
      Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat
      ones. Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies widely in style, complexity and cost. <br>
      Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made
      by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even
      thousands of dollars a pair. <br>
      Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing.
      <br>
      they are increasingly made from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials. <br>
      Though the human foot is adapted to varied terrain and climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental
      hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes protect against. Some shoes are worn as safety
      equipment, such as steel-soled boots which are required on construction sites. <br>

      Shoes are essential for humans. <br>
      There are differnet kindes of shoes for example sneakers, bootees, running shoes, slip-on shoes, skateshoes. <br>
      That are usefull for dirfferent things. Running shoes are for running, sneakers for free time use. bootees for
      winter etc <br>

    </p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>
      All shoes have a sole which is the bottom of the shoe.<br>
      The insole is the interior bottom of a shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed.<br>
      The outsole is the layer in direct contact with the ground. <br>
      The midsole is the layer between the insole and outsole.<br>
      The heel is the bottom rear part of a shoe. Is's function to support the heel foot.<br>
      The upper helps hold the shoe onto the foot<br>
      The vamp is the front part of the shoe, starting behind the toe, extending around the eyelets and tongue and
      towards back part of the shoe.<br>
      The toe box is the part that covers and protects the toes.<br>
      <br>

      The first steps towards mechanisation were taken during the Napoleonic Wars by the engineer, Marc Brunel <br>
      He developed machinery for the mass-production of boots for the soldiers of the British Army. <br>
      n 1812, he devised a scheme for making nailed-boot-making machinery that automatically fastened soles to uppers by
      means of metallic pins or nails. <br>
      With the support of the Duke of York, the shoes were manufactured, and, due to their strength, cheapness, and
      durability, were introduced for the use of the army. <br> In the same year, the use of screws and staples was
      patented by Richard Woodman.
    </p>

    <h2>Measures and sizes</h2>
    <p>
      The measure of a foot for a shoe is from the heel to the longest toe. Shoe size is an alphanumerical indication of
      the fitting size of a shoe for a person. </br>
      Often it just consists of a number indicating the length because many shoemakers only provide a standard width for
      economic reasons. <br>
      There are several different shoe-size systems that are used worldwide. These systems differ in what they measure,
      what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. <br>
      Only a few systems also take the width of the feet into account. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for
      different types of shoes (e.g., men's, women's, children's, sport, or safety shoes). <br>
      Units for shoe sizes vary widely around the world. European sizes are measured in Paris Points, which are worth
      two-thirds of a centimeter. <br>
      The UK and American units are approximately one-quarter of an inch, starting at 8Â¼ inches. <br>
      Men's and women's shoe sizes often have different scales. <br>
      Shoes size is often measured using a Brannock Device, which can determine both the width and length size values of
      the foot. <br>
    </p>



    <h2>Accesories</h2>
    <p>
      Foam tap: a small foam pad placed under the ball of the foot to push the foot up and back if the shoe is too
      loose.
      Heel grip: used to prevent the shoe from slipping on the heel if the fit is not perfect
      Overshoes or galoshes: a rubber covering placed over shoes for rain and snow protection.
      Shoe bag: a bag that protects shoes against damage when they are not being worn.
      Shoe brush and polishing cloth: used to apply polish to shoes.
      Shoe insert, insole or inner sole: orthopedic or regular insert of various materials for cushioning, improved fit,
      reduced abrasion or to keep shoe fresh and increase its durability. These include padding and inner linings.
      Inserts may also be used to correct foot problems.</li>
      Shoe polish: a waxy material spread on shoes to improve appearance and glossiness, and provide protection.
      Shoe stretcher: a tool for making a shoe longer or wider or for reducing discomfort in areas of a shoe.
      Shoe tree: placed inside the shoe when user is not wearing it, to help maintain the shoe's shape.
